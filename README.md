## Start server

An application can be started in two modes: development and production.<br>
When server is starting an application will print message to the console. This message tells you which port, host and mode is used.<br>
To stop server, terminate its process by pressing the keys combination `Ctrl+C`.

### Development mode

To start server in development mode, run the next command in the terminal.

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Server wiil start from source files and all internal server errors will be printed to the console.

### Production mode

To start server in production mode, run the next command in the terminal.

### Setup Environment

To setup port and host thats are used to listeninig server, you can edit `.env` file.<br>
To read env file, an application use the `dotenv` module. Read its [documentation](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme) to know how to works with the `.env` file.<br>
If an env file does not exist an application will be listening `localhost` on the port `3000`.

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

This command runs webpack to build an application and to put them into the `dist/` folder.<br>
When building is completed the server will started from the build file `dist/main.js`.

## Web API

An application implement a very simple REST Like API that is reachable by url `http://${host}:${port}/person`.
